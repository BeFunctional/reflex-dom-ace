This package provides a Reflex wrapper around the ACE editor.  It is very
incomplete and was derived from [code written for
hsnippet](https://github.com/mightybyte/hsnippet/blob/64cc17d2bf2bcce219f3ab8e96b7fd6071d5b56b/frontend/src/ACE.hs).
This is also intended to serve as an example of how to structure FFI packages
that rely on external JS packages.
